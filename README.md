## This project is a restaurant reference application. 
This project has three different pages, and each page contains information, and different features for three different restaurants. The restaurants referenced are McDoanld's, Red Lobster, and Starbucks. Below are the details for each one.

## McDonald's
This page contains the standard McDonald's logo in the navigation bar, the McDonald's official catchphrase, and three links to the right of it. Those three links are McDoanld's, Red Lobster, and StarBucks. Underneath the nav bar there are more images, including three images aligned one on top of the other to the right of the page, a picture of a bacon egg and cheese McGriddle that turns sideways when hovered over, and finally a nice big picture of a cartoonish burger. Underneath the burger are 6 buttons, and when clicked on, each button takes you to a separate page of the official McDonald's website. This navigation portal of buttons are each named appropriately for the section of the official website that you want to view. These buttons are named: **Home, Menu, Locator, Nutrition, Contact, and Careers**. 

The colors and theme for this page are red and yellow.

## Red Lobster
The Red Lobster page begins with a picture of a red lobster in the navigation menu, followed by Red Lobster's offical slogan to the right, proceeded by the same three navigation links that McDonald's includes. Underneath is a welcome to the red lobster page header, and under are two linked clickable section: **Check Out The Website, and R.S.V.P**. When Check Out The Website is clicked, you enter a filterable list section that has a header, a copyright footer, and it acts a miniature portal of links that each lead to a different section of the official Red Lobster website. The sections are **Menu, Special, Gift Cards, and Rewards**. Included into this design is a back button, which when clicked upon returns back to the main landing page of this page.

Finally, the R.S.V.P section contais a form that accepts first name, last name, phone number, date, and the current time that the form is being filled out. Under these input fields are a reset and submit button, and this form can be used for guests who are making reservations for seating at Red Lobster. Then there is a local storage field where visitors can input data and have it saved to the local storage of their browser. Complete with **Clear localStorage** and **Empty localStorage** buttons. This section also contains a back button. The theme is red and grey.

## Starbucks

Starbucks, the last page of this application, follows a similar style as the previous two. At the navigation bar on top, you will find the official Starbucks logo, their slogan, and the same three navigation links as the former pages. Next you will find a "Welcome to StarBucks" header with a **Favorites** button to the side of it. When the Favorites button is clicked, a local storage form section will be opened on the left side of the browser. Users can enter their favorite items and they will appear in another section of the website explained later. 

The clickable sections of this website are **Check Out The Website, Sign Up For A Membership, Gallery, and Favorites List**. Check Out The Website contains a filterable list and a back button, as well as Home, Coffees, Tea, Menu, Rewards, and Gift Cards clickable links, that each take the visitor to that location of the official Starbucks website. Sign Up For a Membership opens to a form with 5 fields: First Name, Last Name, Phone Number, Date and Email. Users who would like to sign up for a Starbucks membership that provides rewards will use this form. Next, is the Gallery.

Gallery contains a simple yet theme colored gallery with 5 images, and it also has a back button, a header, and a copyright footer like the rest of the sections. Lastly, Favorites List, is the section where the information that has been entered into the Favorites section, when using the **Favorites** button that was explained earlier, will appear. It simply contains a header, a **List Favorites** button that will show the information that has been entered into local storage when clicked, and a copyright footer. There is also a back button in this section and the theme colors for this page are green, black, and grey.

## Conclusion
That is all there is to this restaurant reference application. I hope it was as much as an enjoyment for you to read through this documentation, as it was for me to create this application.
